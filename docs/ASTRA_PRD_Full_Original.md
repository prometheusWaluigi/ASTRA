## Functional Requirements

The system shall provide the following key capabilities:

### Data Ingestion & Management

#### Astronomical Ephemeris Import
The system must ingest precise celestial data (planetary positions, motions, etc.) for given time ranges. This could involve integration with sources like NASA JPL ephemerides or internal libraries. Accuracy is crucial ‚Äì to meaningfully align with human events, planetary coordinates and derived astrological constructs (e.g. zodiac positions, aspects) must be calculated correctly to the minute or second of arc.

#### User/Event Data Input
Users can input symbolic data about human experience. This may include:
- Personal data (e.g. birth date, personality type, significant life events with dates)
- Collective data (historical events timeline)
- Narrative text (from which symbolic themes can be extracted)

The system should support:
- Structured formats (CSV of events with timestamps, JSON of narrative annotations)
- Potentially unstructured text (with NLP to extract entities and timestamped sentiments)

#### Symbolic Encoding
The raw inputs must be converted into a structured representation:

For celestial data:
- Computing positions in an archetypal space
- Mapping planetary position to zodiacal archetype
- Calculating aspect angles between planets

For human data:
- Encoding psychological or narrative information into quantifiable symbols
- Mapping Jungian archetypes or sentiment values to vectors
- Tagging events with archetypes like "hero's journey stage" or Big Five personality scores

All data will be time-indexed to allow alignment.

### Quantum-State Modeling

#### State Construction
The system will construct a joint quantum-inspired state that fuses celestial and human factors:
- A logical state in a high-dimensional vector space
- Basis dimensions could correspond to archetypal variables
- Provide an API or engine to create and manipulate state representations

Example: Modeling a single person
- Psychological profile as one vector (e.g., 8-dimensional Jungian type vector„Äê38‚Ä†L35-L43„Äë)
- Planetary configuration as another vector
- Joint state as their tensor product

#### Entanglement & Coherence Computation
For any given timeframe or event, compute measures indicating the degree of coupling between subsystems:
- Person vs. cosmos
- Different archetypal factors within the person

Calculations include:
- Entanglement measures (e.g., entanglement entropy)
- Checking joint state separability criteria„Äê33‚Ä†L1-L8„Äë
- Coherence measures (alignment of component phases)

Capability to analyze multiple individuals or data streams, with caution about complexity growth.

#### Geometric Phase Analysis
Compute a Berry phase analog for cyclic processes:
- Track "phase" accumulated in psychological state during cyclic events
- Example: Saturn's return to natal position (~every 29.5 years)
- Mathematically track path through state space
- Compute phase difference between cycle start and end„Äê37‚Ä†L1-L4„Äë

A non-zero geometric phase indicates a path-dependent effect ‚Äì a potential marker of meaningful transformation.

#### Simulation of Perturbations
Enable researchers to perform what-if scenarios:
- Perturb celestial or human state
- Observe impact on system
- Recompute quantum-state and metrics dynamically

Example: "What if Mars was not in retrograde during this period ‚Äì how would the entanglement measure with my life events change?"

### Topological Pattern Analysis

#### Persistent Homology Computation
Apply persistent homology to identify topological features across multiple thresholds„Äê43‚Ä†L25-L34„Äë„Äê43‚Ä†L47-L55„Äë:
- Build simplicial complexes from data
- Compute Betti numbers and persistence diagrams
- Identify persistent patterns (cycles, clusters, voids)
- Distinguish meaningful signals from noise„Äê44‚Ä†L972-L980„Äë

Example outputs:
- "One dominant cycle of length ~30 years persists"
- "Two persistent clusters of events exist"

#### Betti Number Analysis in Archetypal Space
Compute Betti numbers (Œ≤0, Œ≤1, Œ≤2, ‚Ä¶) for data points in high-dimensional archetypal space:
- Describe connected components, loops, voids
- Reveal narrative structures
- Detect repeating narrative loops
- Identify isolated event clusters

Cosmological data interpretation:
- Œ≤1 might correspond to cyclical orbits
- Œ≤2 might represent void-like activity gaps

#### Topology Alignment
Compare topology of human vs. cosmic data:
- Build topological signatures (persistence diagrams)
- Quantify similarity between datasets
- Detect shared cycles
- Identify "holes" filled by different data streams
- Provide evidence of coupling through topological alignment
